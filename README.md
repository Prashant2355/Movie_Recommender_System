# 🎬 Movie-Recommender-System
A **content-based Movie Recommender System** that suggests personalized movie recommendations by analyzing movie metadata and textual features. This project demonstrates how data analysis and NLP techniques can be used to improve content discovery—similar to recommendation systems used by streaming platforms.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze movie metadata and build a recommendation engine that returns similar movies based on user-selected titles. The system leverages text vectorization and similarity analysis to generate meaningful recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features :-

- Content-based filtering using movie metadata (genres, cast, crew, overview)

- Text vectorization using **TF-IDF**

- Similarity measurement using **Cosine Similarity**

- Returns **Top 5** movie recommendations for a given input

- Clean and interactive interface for user input


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python

- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy

- **Machine Learning / NLP:** Scikit-learn

- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF, CountVectorizer

- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity

## 📊 Key Highlights :-
- Built a **recommender engine** that returns the **top** 5 similar movies to the input movie.
- Cleaned and processed large movie datasets using **pandas**.
- Vectorized textual data like genres and overviews using **TF-IDF** for similarity calculations.

## 📁 Dataset

- **TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset** (or similar)

- Contains movie metadata such as title, genre, cast, crew, and overview
