# movie-recommender-system
This project is a Machine Learning–based Movie Recommender System that suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing preferences and behaviors. The goal is to mimic the recommendation engines used by streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime.

## Features :-

- Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata (genre, cast, director, etc.)

- **Cosine Similarity** for measuring movie similarity

- **TF-IDF Vectorization** on movie overviews and tags

- Clean and interactive user interface for entering movie choices and getting suggestions


## Technologies Used :-

- **Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy**

- **Vectorization: TF-IDF, CountVectorizer**

- **Similarity Algorithm: Cosine Similarity**

## Key Highlights :-

- Built a **recommender engine** that returns the **top** 5–10 similar movies to the input movie.

- Cleaned and processed large movie datasets using **pandas**.

- Vectorized textual data like genres and overviews using **TF-IDF** for similarity calculations.

## How to Run :-

- Clone the repo.

- Run movie_recommender.ipynb to see the recommendation engine in action

## Dataset :-

- Used **TMDb 5000** Movie Dataset or similar, containing movie metadata and overviews.
